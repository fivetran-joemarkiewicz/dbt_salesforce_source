# Salesforce Source dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce_source/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Cleans, tests, and prepares your Salesforce data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce) for analysis.
- Generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your Salesforce data via the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce_source/)
- Materializes staging tables which leverage data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce/#schemainformation) and is intended to work simultaneously with our [Salesforce modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce)
    - Refer to our [Docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce_source/#!/overview/salesforce_source/models/?g_v=1) for more details about these materialized models. 

# 🤔  Who is the target user of this dbt package?
- You use Fivetran's [Salesforce connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce)
- You use dbt
- You want a staging layer that cleans, tests, and prepares your Salesforce data for analysis
- (Optional) You want to make use of the [Salesforce Modeling dbt Package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce)

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
To effectively install this package and leverage the pre-made models, you will follow the below steps:
## Step 1: Pre-Requisites
You will need to ensure you have the following before leveraging the dbt package.
- **Connector**: Have the Fivetran Salesforce connector syncing data into your warehouse. 
- **Database support**: This package has been tested on **Postgres**, **Spark**, **Redshift**, **Snowflake**, and **BigQuery**.

Ensure you are using one of these supported databases.
- **dbt Version**: This dbt package requires you have a functional dbt project that utilizes a dbt version within the respective range `>=1.0.0, <2.0.0`.
## Step 2: Installing the Package
Include the following salesforce_source package version in your `packages.yml`
> Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/salesforce_source
    version: [">=0.5.0", "<0.6.0"]
```
## Step 3: Configure Your Variables
### Database and Schema Variables
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `salesforce` schema. If this is not where your Salesforce data is (perhaps your Salesforce schema is `salesforce_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
    salesforce_database: your_database_name
    salesforce_schema: your_schema_name 

    # if an individual source table has a different name than expected, provide the name of the table as it appears in your warehouse
    salesforce_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name  
```
### Adding Passthrough Columns
This package includes all source columns defined in the `generate_columns.sql` macro. To add additional columns to this package, do so using our pass-through column variables. This is extremely useful if you'd like to include custom fields to the package.


```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  account_pass_through_columns: [account_custom_field_1, account_custom_field_2]
  opportunity_pass_through_columns: [my_opp_custom_field]
  user_pass_through_columns: [users_have_custom_fields_too, lets_add_them_all]
```

### Disabling Models
Your connector may not be syncing all tabes that this package references. This might be because you are excluding those tables. If you are not using those tables, you can disable the corresponding functionality in the package by specifying the variable in your dbt_project.yml. By default, all packages are assumed to be true. You only have to add variables for tables you want to disable, like so:

The `salesforce__user_role_enabled` variable below refers to the `user_role` table. 

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  salesforce__user_role_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the user_role table

```
The corresponding metrics from the disabled tables will not populate in the downstream models.

### Salesforce History Mode
If you have Salesforce [History Mode](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/feature/history-mode) enabled for your connector, the source tables will include all historical records. This package is designed to deal with non-historical data. As such, if you have History Mode enabled you will want to set the desired `using_[table]_history_mode_active_records` variable(s) as `true` to filter for only active records. These variables are disabled by default; however, you may add the below variable configuration within your `dbt_project.yml` file to enable the feature.
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  using_account_history_mode_active_records: true      # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_opportunity_history_mode_active_records: true  # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_user_role_history_mode_active_records: true    # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_user_history_mode_active_records: true         # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
```

## (Optional) Step 4: Additional Configurations
### Change the Build Schema
By default, this package builds the GitHub staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_salesforce`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your GitHub staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    salesforce_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

### Adding Formula Fields as Pass Through Columns
The source tables Fivetran syncs do not include formula fields. The [Salesforce Formula Utils](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_formula_utils) package allows you to generate those fields in order to map Salesforce formulas to existing tables. To pass through the fields, add the following configuration:

To your `packages.yml` file:
```yml
packages:

  - package: fivetran/salesforce_formula_utils
    version: [">=0.6.0", "<0.7.0"]
```

To your `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yml
# Using the opportunity source table as example, update the opportunity variable to reference your newly created model that contains the formula fields:
  opportunity: "{{ ref('your_table_name_here') }}"

# In addition, add the desired field names as pass through columns
  opportunity_pass_through_columns: ['field_1','field_2']
```

## Step 5: Finish Setup
Your dbt project is now setup to successfully run the dbt package models! You can now execute `dbt run` and `dbt test` to have the models materialize in your warehouse and execute the data integrity tests applied within the package.

## (Optional) Step 6: Orchestrate your package models with Fivetran
Fivetran offers the ability for you to orchestrate your dbt project through the [Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt) product. Refer to the linked docs for more information on how to setup your project for orchestration through Fivetran. 

# 🔍 Does this package have dependencies?
This dbt package is dependent on the following dbt packages. For more information on the below packages, refer to the [dbt hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) site.
> **If you have any of these dependent packages in your own `packages.yml` I highly recommend you remove them to ensure there are no package version conflicts.**
```yml
packages:
    - package: fivetran/fivetran_utils
      version: [">=0.3.0", "<0.4.0"]

    - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
      version: [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"]
```
